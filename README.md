Introduction
This repository is dedicated to solving pattern problems, a popular category in coding interviews and competitive programming. Patterns include a variety of shapes and designs made using nested loops and conditional logic. Striver's pattern problems provide a great way to practice algorithmic thinking and learn different ways to approach problem-solving.

Patterns Covered
Star Patterns
Number Patterns
Alphabet Patterns
Pyramid Patterns
Diamond Patterns
Inverted Patterns
Zigzag Patterns
And many more...
Each problem is categorized into folders based on the type of pattern and its complexity level.

Solution Approach
For each pattern problem, I have provided:

Problem Statement: A clear description of the pattern to be generated.
Algorithm: A step-by-step approach used to solve the problem.
Code: The actual code implementation in [Programming Language].
Output: Sample output for better visualization.
The solutions are designed to be simple and efficient, making it easier for beginners to understand the logic behind pattern generation.
